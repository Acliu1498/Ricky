Actions
=======
When formatting the action object the first key is "action" and its value is a string.

The current supported values for the action key are:

- move
- move_joint
- move_relative
- close_grip
- open_grip
- take_pic

Additionally, every action can be given a comment key that is used as a description of the action object.

move
-------
The move action moves the right limb to the desired point using inverse kinematics. To use move the other keys that must be included are:

- position: {'x': float, 'y': float, 'z': float}
    - This is the desired 3D point

- orientation: {'x': float, 'y': float, 'z': float, 'w': float}
    - This is the desired orientation

- speed: int
    - How fast the action will be executed

move_joint
----------
The move_joint action moves the arm to exact joint rotation provided.

- joint_angles: {"right_j6": float, "right_j5": float, "right_j4": float, "right_j3": float, "right_j2": float, "right_j1": float, "right_j0": float}
    - the rotation of each joint in the arm.

- speed: int
    - How fast the action will be executed

move_relative
-------------
The move_relative action moves the arm relative to its current position.

- position: {'x': float, 'y': float, 'z': float}
    - This is the desired change from current point

- orientation: {'x': float, 'y': float, 'z': float, 'w': float}
    - This is the desired change from the current orientation

- speed: int
    - How fast the action will be executed

close_grip
----------
closes the gripper

open_grip
---------
opens the gripper
