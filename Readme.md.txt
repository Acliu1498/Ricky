## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- Ubunutu Xenial *THIS VERSION MUST BE USED
- ROS Kinetic *THIS VERSION MUST BE USED
- Python 3

This workstation setup [guide](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/intera/Workstation_Setup) can be followed to install all the necessary prerequisites.

### Installing
First, ensure that Ricky is in sdk mode. To do that this guide [here](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/intera/Upgrade_Sawyer_to_Intera_SDK#Switch_Robot_from_Intera_MFG_to_SDK_Mode) can be followed.
Once done, Ricky's screen should look like this:
